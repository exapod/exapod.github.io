# PROJECT 1 

Welcome to your first SparkFun Inventorâ€™s Kit project. Each **project** is broken up into several
**circuits**, the last circuit being a culmination of the technologies that came before. There are five
projects total, each designed to help you learn about new technologies and concepts. This first project
will set the foundation for the rest and will aid in helping you understand the fundamentals of circuit
building and electricity!

In Project 1, you will learn about *Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)*, *resistors*,
*inputs*, *outputs* and *sensors*. The first project will be to build and program your own multicolored night-light! The night-light uses a sensor to turn on an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED when it gets dark, and you will be able to change the
color using an input knob.


## New Ideas

**NOTE:** Each project will introduce new concepts and components, which will be described in more detail as you progress through the circuits.
